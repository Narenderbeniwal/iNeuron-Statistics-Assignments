## Assignment 10 
1.  A chicken lays n eggs. Each egg independently does or doesn’t hatch, with probability p of
hatching. For each egg that hatches, the chick does or doesn’t survive (independently of the
other eggs), with probability s of survival. Let N ⇠ Bin(n, p) be the number of eggs which
hatch, X be the number of chicks which survive, and Y be the number of chicks which hatch
but don’t survive (so X + Y = N). Find the marginal PMF of X, and the joint PMF of X and Y .
Are they independent?

## Assignment 9

1. You are going to play 2 games of chess with an opponent whom you have never played against before (for the sake of this problem). Your opponent is equally likely to be a beginner, intermediate, or a master. Depending on

(a) What is your probability of winning the first game?

(b) Congratulations: you won the first game! Given this information, what is the probability

that you will also win the second game

(c) Explain the distinction between assuming that the outcomes of the games are independent and assuming that they are conditionally independent given the opponent’s skill level. Which of these assumptions seems more reasonable, and why?

## Assignment 8 
1. A crime is committed by one of two suspects, A and B. Initially, there is equal evidence
against both of them. In further investigation at the crime scene, it is found that the guilty
party had a blood type found in 10% of the population. Suspect A does match this blood
type, whereas the blood type of Suspect B is unknown. (a) Given this new information, what
is the probability that A is the guilty party? (b) Given this new information, what is the
probability that B’s blood type matches that found at the crime scene?'''

## Assignment 7

1. A spam filter is designed by looking at commonly occurring phrases in spam. Suppose that
80% of email is spam. In 10% of the spam emails, the phrase “free money” is used, whereas
this phrase is only used in 1% of non-spam emails. A new email has just arrived, which does
mention “free money”. What is the probability that it is spam?

## Assignment 6

1. Give an example of 3 events A, B, C which are pairwise independent but not independent.
Hint: find an example where whether C occurs is completely determined if we know whether
A occurred and whether B occurred, but completely undetermined if we know only one of
these things.
2. A bag contains one marble which is either green or blue, with equal probabilities. A green
marble is put in the bag (so there are 2 marbles now), and then a random marble is taken
out. The marble taken out is green. What is the probability that the remaining marble is also
green?
