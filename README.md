## Assignment 10 
1.  A chicken lays n eggs. Each egg independently does or doesn’t hatch, with probability p of
hatching. For each egg that hatches, the chick does or doesn’t survive (independently of the
other eggs), with probability s of survival. Let N ⇠ Bin(n, p) be the number of eggs which
hatch, X be the number of chicks which survive, and Y be the number of chicks which hatch
but don’t survive (so X + Y = N). Find the marginal PMF of X, and the joint PMF of X and Y .
Are they independent?

## Assignment 9

1. You are going to play 2 games of chess with an opponent whom you have never played against before (for the sake of this problem). Your opponent is equally likely to be a beginner, intermediate, or a master. Depending on

(a) What is your probability of winning the first game?

(b) Congratulations: you won the first game! Given this information, what is the probability

that you will also win the second game

(c) Explain the distinction between assuming that the outcomes of the games are independent and assuming that they are conditionally independent given the opponent’s skill level. Which of these assumptions seems more reasonable, and why?

## Assignment 8 
1. A crime is committed by one of two suspects, A and B. Initially, there is equal evidence
against both of them. In further investigation at the crime scene, it is found that the guilty
party had a blood type found in 10% of the population. Suspect A does match this blood
type, whereas the blood type of Suspect B is unknown. (a) Given this new information, what
is the probability that A is the guilty party? (b) Given this new information, what is the
probability that B’s blood type matches that found at the crime scene?'''
